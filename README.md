# Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks


This repo was inspired by Paper [Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187)

I would test popular training tricks as many as I can for improving image classification accuarcy, feel
free to leave a comment about the tricks you want me to test(please write the referenced paper along with
the tricks)


## dataset
